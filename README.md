### Frontend / Admin Panel  (Portfolio)

Used in conjunction with:  
[Backend repo](https://github.com/lanc2112b/portfolio_php)  

A very alpha version of the app, barely MVP, that allows me to change content on my portfolio page.  
A lot of improvements are needed, and stil a number of features left to add.  


#### Uses  

React  
Tailwind  
Axios  
Luxon   
Classnames (not really needed, I'll probably remove this at some point).  
React router dom  
Tailwind forms plugin.   


##### Planned changes  

Adding portfolio items - make optional 'hosted_url' & 'github_url', not all posts will need them afterall.
